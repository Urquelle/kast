# Kast

An experimental programming language

**NOT READY YET**

But you can download current builds from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kast-lang/kast/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

[See more on the website](https://kast-lang.org)

## Todo

- Document current state
- Mark builtin fns with contexts (e.g. print should require io)
- Sum types should have better syntax (fix "ofnone"). I think it should be "let binding" for bindings and "variant" for variants?
- let assert pattern
- Unnamed tuples
- Lists
- Better error reporting (stack traces / reasons why syntax is not parsed)
- Ir as value so we can write compiler (glsl)
- Traits (partially done, works for concrete types only)
- Delimited continuations
- Effect system (half done, have contexts)
- More examples
- Borrow checker
- Tests

## Look into:

- rankNtypes (check)
- user-defined rewrite rules
- GADT
- differentiable
- software transational memory
- dependent types
- refinement types
- oncapture callback for closures?
