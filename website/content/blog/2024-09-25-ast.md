In Kast there is no builtin syntax. Except for syntax for adding new syntax.

The standard syntax is defined in `std/syntax.ks`, but you can ignore it and define your own instead.

When parsing code into AST, Kast treats everything as an expression,
and every syntax definition is expanding what an expression can be.

For example, you could define a ternary if like in Python like so:

```
syntax ternary-if -> 20 = true_value "if" cond "else" false_value
```

This defines syntax for `ternary-if` (which should be defined somewhere)
which is right associative (`->`), has priority `20`,
and is defined as `true_value "if" cond "else" false_value` where
`true_value`, `cond` and `false_value` can be anything defined by
other syntax rules with higher priority (or be a simple single-token value),
and the `if` and `else` are "keywords".

Keywords can also be punctuation, so a ternary operator from C could be defined as:

```
syntax ternary_operator -> 20 = cond "?" then ":" else
```

<!-- does that make sense? -->

## Storing syntax definitions

Syntax definitions are stored in a tree data structure similar to a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).

An edge in this tree is a keyword, and a number of values that are expected before that keyword.

In some nodes of the tree we can also finish the syntax definition by following with a certain number of final values.

For example, `true_value "if" cond "else" false_value` definition like above would be split into:

- `_ if` - a value followed by "if" keyword
- `_ else` - a value followed by "else" keyword
- `_` - final value

If, in addition to this syntax we also had a similar syntax defintion but without the else case
(`syntax just-if -> 20 = true_value "if" cond`), then we would have a tree like this:

```
root {
    edge "_ if" {
        finish "_" = just-if
        edge "_ else" {
            finish "_" = ternary-if
        }
    }
}
```

The AST parsing algorithm takes a sequence of tokens and a collection of syntax definitions stored in such data structure and constructs an AST.

An example of parsed AST for `a if b else c if d`:

```
ternary-if {
    true_value = a
    cond = b
    false_value = just-if {
        true_value = c
        cond = d
    }
}
```
